# interactive-buttons-demo

An interactive app that allows users to input colors, and when the 'Save' button is pressed, the corresponding cells change color to blue, red, or green. The data is stored locally to persist across page reloads.

## Features

- **Input Colors**: Users can enter color names (e.g., red, green, blue) into input fields.
- **Save Button**: When the 'Save' button is pressed, the cells corresponding to the inputs change their background color to the specified color.
- **Persistent Data**: The selected colors are stored locally in the browser, so they persist even after the page is reloaded.
